    <p class="title">Co-Founder, CEO</p>
    <p class="description" style="display:none;">
      Steve joined forces with Don in May 2015. Over a steak and a coke, Don painted his vision for a world where data is power and by breaking down barriers to access that data you have the opportunity to completely change the world. After a career helping to build other people’s businesses, this represented a welcome change. Sealing the deal by splitting the bill 50/50, at the time he had no idea it would lead to him relocating his family to Scotland and taking up mountain biking (or pushing a bike up a hill) as a new hobby.

    <p class="title">Co-Founder, CTO</p>
    <p class="description" style="display:none;">
      Graham very quickly completed the trinity of the executive team. Living in Australia at the time, a 30 minute Skype, in which we “had him at hello”, flipped his life upside down - literally. Within a few months he relocated to the other side of the world; a long way from our very first call with investors where Graham had to dial in from his car with his heaters on full blast in the middle of the night at a ski resort in Australia. His 20 year career building large complicated data systems had all been leading up to this point. When he’s not coding he is either riding horses, climbing up mountains or skiing down them.
